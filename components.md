## Components

### [Assignments](assignments.md)

You will complete two assignments, where the primary learning objective of each is to give you the basic development skills to deliver on the project.

### [Participation](participation.md)

You will actively participate in in-class and online dicussions.

In a typical week, you will respond online regarding a reading for the week. This response is to prepare you for an in-class discussion about the topic and reading. The primary learning objective for this style of participation is to help you to develop both oral and written communication and critical thinking skills. I am interested in your ability to think beyond the material, bring in ideas and thoughts of your own to bear on the topic at hand. Don't simply summarize or restate the reading. I will provide you ongoing feedback about your participation performance.

### [Seminar Topic](topic.md)

You will develop a discussion on a topic of your choice. Ideas for topics [topics](topic.md). You will identify readings, create a web-based handout, and lead an in-class discussion on the chosen topic. The primary learning objective here is to develop both a depth of understanding in a specific area relating to mixed reality and articulating that understanding in a way that is appropriate for an audience of your peers.

You will also be paired up with another student and you will provide each other feedback on your respective topics.

### [Project](project.md)

The project is the primary "development" component of this course. Here, you will design and develop a mixed reality experience. You will be assessed on your progress and improvement of your project (via documentation), a clear articulation of what you expect to develop (in the proposal), and a clear articulation of what you have developed (in the final report) based on feedback from your peers. This is a team-based project component, though the size of your project team is up to you (my recommendation is to select a team size of three peers or more).

This component has several learning objectives: first, you will learn how to design a mixed reality experience; second, you will learn how to engage with users and to use that feedback to improve your project design; third, you will learn how to work in a team to partition tasks, and finally, you will learn how to present your work in a way that highlights your design process.
