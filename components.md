# Assessment Components

This is a project-based course with seminar-style components. Thus, you will be evaluated on your completion of written and coding components, contributing to both online and in-person discussion, as well as your engagement with your client.

## Components

### [Assignments](assignments.md)

You will complete two assignments, where the primary learning objective of each is to give you the basic development skills to deliver on the project.

### [Participation](participation.md)

You will actively participate in in-class and online dicussions. In a typical week, you will respond online to a discussion question regarding a reading for the week. This response is to prepare you for an in-class discussion about the topic and reading. The primary learning objective for this style of participation is to help you to develop both oral and written communication and critical thinking skills. I am interested here less in your ability to simply regurgitate the information you have taken in, and more in your ability to think beyond the material, bringing in ideas and thoughts of your own to bear on the topic at hand. I will provide you ongoing feedback about your performance on your participation.

### [Topic](topic.md)

In a pair, you will develop a discussion on a topic of your choice (ideally selected from the set of available [topics](topic.md)), where you will prepare a web-based handout, identify readings, and an in-class presentation on the chosen topic.These pairings should be distinct from the project teams. The primary learning objective here is to develop both a depth of understanding in a specific area relating to mixed reality experience design, and articulating that understanding in a way that is appropriate for an audience of your peers.

### [Project](project.md)

The project is the primary "development" component of this course. Here, you will design and develop a mixed reality experience. You will be assessed on your progress and improvement of your project (via documentation), a clear articulation of what you expect to develop (in the proposal), and a clear articulation of what you have developed (in the final report) based on feedback from your peers. This is a team-based project component, though the size of your project team is up to you (my recommendation is to select a team size of three peers or more).

I expect you to blow our socks off. I want ours to be the best projects at the annual CPSC Showcase event. And, I want these projects to be the way in which you communicate the outcomes of your degree to the outside world.

This component has several learning objectives: first, you will learn how to design a mixed reality experience; second, you will learn how to engage with users (potentially through various failure modes) and to use that feedback to improve your project design; third, you will learn how to work in a team to partition tasks, and finally, you will learn how to present your work in a way that highlights your design process.
