# Seminar Topics

On a topic of your choice you will identify readings and lead an in-class discussion. The primary learning objective here is to develop both a depth of understanding in a specific area relating to mixed reality experience design, and to articulate that understanding in a way that is appropriate for an audience of your peers.

You will also be paired up with another student to provide each other feedback on your respective topics. The student you are paired with will not be presenting on your topic and is not responsible for creating content for you.

## Responsibilities

For the topic you choose you will identify the readings, develop the topic, and prepare the presentation. The role of your partner is to help develop the topic idea, and then to provide formal feedback on the suitability of the topic materials, as well as to identify opportunities for improving the materials.

## Components

| Topic Part 2a: Draft Presentation              | 2   |
| Topic Part 2b: Draft Presentation Partner Feedback            | 2   |
| Topic Part 3: Seminar Presentation and Reflection                   | 10  |

### Topic Part 1: Proposal

Develop a one paragraph proposal for your topic. This should mainly be identfying the topic, and an early set of four candidate papers (ideally research papers) and two examples (either webpages, images, etc.). You should sketch a brief outline of the kinds of things you think you might discuss for your topic presentation and the webpage.

### Topic Part 2: Draft Presentation

(Draft Presentation 2a): Develop a 20-30 minute presentation on the material you have collected. This should be in the form of a powerpoint presentation. It may contain videos, but ensure that the videos do not run (collectively) for over 5 minutes (I want you to be presenting). This presentation should be self-contained, though can link to other materials people may find interesting. Develop an initial set of questions that the class can discuss following your presentation.

(Partner Feedback 2b): For another student. Given their powerpoint presentation deck, annotate this deck with suggestions on how to improve the presentation. You may also consider developing feedback in a separate document that you provide to the presenter in addition to/instead of annotating the presentation slide deck. Provide this feedback to both the instructor (you will be graded on the quality of your feedback), and to the original author of the powerpoint deck.

### Topic 3: Seminar Presentation and Reflection

(Primary): You will present your topic for the class based on your original draft, as well as any feedback provided to you by your partner and from me. You will also lead the discussion on the topic. In total, this should run about thirty minutes. You can expect that the students will have read the reading that you have provided in advance of the class. A good way to help this discussion along is through a posing questions throughout the presentation.

(Partner): Your job is to be the lead discussant during the discussion. This means that you will be ready to respond to each question posed by the leader of the discussion.

(Primary): Once you have completed your presentation, you will write a short half-page reflection essay on your presentation. Here, you will consider what elements of your presentation went well, and how you could have improved the presentation -- both the deck itself, and in your delivery of the material. Consider here also how you went about leading the discussion, and how this could have been improved as well.

## Possible Topics

Below are a list of possible topics along with suggested possible readings. Note that this list is not exhaustive and should mainly be considered as a set of suggestions.

For other topics, you should be prepared to lead the class through a discussion of the topic at hand.

* AR in education
* AR collaboration
* AR in mechanical work
* AR/VR/MR for empathy
* AR/VR/MR for pain
* Everyday AR
* Mixed Reality _in_ Games
* Situated and embedded visualizations
* Embodied Interaction Possibilities
* More Applications
	* Architecture
	* Art, cultural heritage, education and training
	* Automotive and aerospace
	* Entertainment, broadcast
	* Industrial, military, emergency response
	* Health, wellbeing, and medical
	* Personal information systems
	* Visual effects / video processing

## A Note

You can propose your own topic. One way to do this is to explore proceedings of conferences like the [International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality](https://dblp.org/db/conf/ismar/index), or the [SIGCHI Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (CHI)](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/chi/), or the [User Interface Software and Technology conferences](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/uist/).

If you'd like to do this, please propose four readings from these conferences that you'd like to explore.
