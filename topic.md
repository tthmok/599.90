# Topics

In a pair, you will develop a discussion on a topic of your choice, where you will prepare a web-based handout, identify readings, and an in-class presentation on the chosen topic. Each pair will generally be made up of one grad student and one undergrad student. These pairings should be distinct from the project teams. The primary learning objective here is to develop both a depth of understanding in a specific area relating to mixed reality experience design, and to articulate that understanding in a way that is appropriate for an audience of your peers.

## Responsibilities

The primary role of the grad student is to identify the readings, develop the topic, and to prepare the presentation. The role of the undergrad student is to help develop the topic idea, and then to provide formal feedback to the grad student on the suitability of the topic materials, as well as to identify opportunities for improving the materials. As the grad student, you may consult with the undergrad student more than the prescribed structure; however, understand as the undergrad, you are only _required_ to provide the feedback as prescribed.

## Components

| Component                                     | U/G | G  |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----|----|
| Topic Part 1: Proposal                        | 1   | 2  |
| Topic Part 2: Webpage and Draft Presentation  | 2   | 13 |
| Topic Part 3: Presentation                    | 2   | 5  |

### Topic Part 1: Proposal

(Grad and U/G together): Develop a one paragraph proposal for your topic. This should mainly be identfying the topic, and an early set of five candidate papers (ideally research papers) and two examples (either webpages, images, etc.). You should sketch a brief outline of the kinds of things you think you might discuss for your topic presentation and the webpage.

### Topic Part 2: Webpage and Draft Presentation

#### Webpage

(Grad): Develop a webpage that summarizes and synthesizes the knowledge you have gained regarding your topic. You should describe the current "state of the art" using the examples that you have found, supporting it with ideas from research papers describing examples in the space. You should then spend some time speculating on future directions for this area -- speculate, for example, on how the user experiences in this area will change in the future, or how society will be affected by changes in this space. Provide the set of readings that support your topic in an annotated bibliography, and identify one reading that every person in the class should read prior to your presentation.

(UGrad): In a one-page to two page essay, critique the webpage. What are some strengths of the webpage, what are some weaknesses, how can it be improved? Provide this feedback to both the instructor (you will be graded on it), and the original author of the webpage.

#### Draft Presentation

(Grad): Develop a 20-30 minute presentation on the material you have collected. This should be in the form of a powerpoint presentation. It may contain videos, but ensure that the videos do not run (collectively) for over 5 minutes (I want you to be presenting). This presentation should be self-contained, though can link to other materials people may find interesting. Develop an initial set of questions that the class can discuss following your presentation.

(UGrad): Given the powerpoint presentation deck, annotate this deck with suggestions on how to improve the presentation. You may also consider developing feedback in a separate document that you provide to the presenter in addition to/instead of annotating the presentation slide deck. Provide this feedback to both the instructor (you will be graded on the quality of your feedback), and to the original author of the powerpoint deck.

### Topic 3: Presentation

(Grad): You will present your topic for the class based on your original draft, as well as any feedback provided to you by your partner and from me. You will also lead the discussion on the topic. In total, this should run about one hour. You can expect that the students will have read the topic webpage as well as the reading that you have provided in advance of the class. A good way to seed this discussion is through a set of discussion questions.

(UGrad): Your job is to be the lead discussant during the discussion. This means that you will be ready to respond to each question posed by the leader of the discussion.

(Grad): Once you have completed your presentation, you will write a short half-page reflection essay on your presentation. Here, you will consider what elements of your presentation went well, and how you could have improved the presentation -- both the deck itself, and in your delivery of the material. Consider here also how you went about leading the discussion, and how this could have been improved as well.

## Possible Topics

Below are a list of possible topics along with suggested possible readings. Note that this list is not exhaustive and should mainly be considered as a set of suggestions.

For technical topics, it might be valuable to consider a lab-style approach, where you teach the class through a simple exercise using some feature exposed by the toolkit.

For other topics, you should be prepared to lead the class through a discussion of the topic at hand.

## A Note

You can propose your own topic. One way to do this is to explore proceedings of conferences like the [International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality](https://dblp.org/db/conf/ismar/index), or the [SIGCHI Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (CHI)](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/chi/), or the [User Interface Software and Technology conferences](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/uist/).

If you'd like to do this, please propose five readings from these conferences that you'd like to explore.
