# Seminar Topics

On a topic of your choice you will identify readings and lead an in-class discussion. The primary learning objective here is to develop both a depth of understanding in a specific area relating to mixed reality experience design, and to articulate that understanding in a way that is appropriate for an audience of your peers.

You will also be paired up with another student to provide each other feedback on your respective topics. The student you are paired with will not be presenting on your topic and is not responsible for creating content for you.

## Responsibilities

For the topic you choose you will identify the readings, develop the topic, and prepare the presentation.

The role of your partner is to help develop the topic idea, and then to provide formal feedback on the suitability of the topic materials, as well as to identify opportunities for improving the materials.

## Components

| Component                                     |  Weighting  |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----|
| T1: Proposal                        | 10  |
| T2a: Draft Presentation              | 25   |
| T2b: Partner Draft Feedback            | 15   |
| T3: Seminar Presentation and Reflection                   | 50 |

### T1: Proposal

Develop a one paragraph proposal for your topic. This should mainly be identfying the topic, and a set of three candidate papers (likely research papers) and two examples (webpages, videos, commercial application etc.). You should sketch a brief outline of the kinds of things you think you might discuss for your topic presentation.

### T2a: Draft Presentation

(Draft Presentation T2a): Develop a 20-30 minute presentation on the material you have collected. This should be in the form of a slide presentation. It may contain videos, but ensure that the videos do not run (collectively) for over 3 minutes (I want you to be presenting). This presentation should be self-contained, though can link to other materials people may find interesting.

Please create a short presentation summary of your topic. This should be 2-3 paragraphs that explain what your topic is and what you plan to cover. Also develop an initial set of questions that the class can discuss following your presentation to be included as part of this summary.

### T2b: Partner Draft Feedback

(Partner Feedback T2b): For another student. Given their presentation deck and summary; annotate their slides with suggestions on how to improve the presentation; point out anything that isn't clear in the summary. You may also consider developing feedback in a separate document that you provide to the presenter in addition to/instead of annotating the presentation slide deck. Provide this feedback to both the instructor (you will be graded on the quality of your feedback), and to the original author of the powerpoint deck.

### T3: Seminar Presentation and Reflection

(Primary): You will present your topic for the class based on your draft, as well as any feedback provided to you by your partner and from me. You will also lead the discussion on the topic. In total, this should run about 25 to 30 minutes. You can expect that some students will have read the reading that you have provided in advance of the class. A good way to help this discussion along is through posing questions throughout the presentation.

(For your Partner): Your job is to be a helper to start discussion going if necessary. This means that you will be ready to respond to each question posed by the leader of the discussion in case nobody else has anything to say.

(Primary): Once you have completed your presentation, you will write a short half-page reflection essay on your presentation. Here, you will consider what elements of your presentation went well, and how you could have improved the presentation -- both the deck itself, and in your delivery of the material. Consider here also how you went about leading the discussion, and how this could have been improved as well.

## Possible Topics

Below are a list of possible topics. This list is not exhaustive and should mainly be considered as a set of suggestions.

* AR in museums
* AR in education
* AR collaboration
* AR in mechanical work
* AR/VR/MR for empathy
* AR/VR/MR for pain
* Everyday AR
* Mixed Reality _in_ Games
* Situated and embedded visualizations
* Embodied Interaction Possibilities
* More Applications
  * Architecture
  * Art, cultural heritage, education and training
  * Automotive and aerospace
  * Entertainment, broadcast
  * Industrial, military, emergency response
  * Health, wellbeing, and medical
  * Personal information systems
  * Visual effects / video processing

**Note**: You can propose your own topic. One way to do this is to explore proceedings of conferences like the [International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality](https://dblp.org/db/conf/ismar/index), or the [SIGCHI Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (CHI)](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/chi/), or the [User Interface Software and Technology conferences](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/uist/).

If you'd like to do this, please propose three readings from these conferences that you'd like to explore.
