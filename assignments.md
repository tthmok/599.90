# Assignments

This component assessed based on completion, where you demonstrate competency on developing two simple AR examples.

The primary learning objective is to acquire the basic knowledge and practice the basic skills necessary to develop augmented reality applications.

## Weighting

| Component                                     | Weighting |

| Assignment 2 (A2): AR Embodied Hello World    | 70  |

## Submission

In both cases, you will have received the training on how to complete the assignment well in advance of the due date. I encourage you to submit early.

To submit, simply send a link (slack or email) to your github repo for the assignment. The repo should include a screenshot and explanation of what should be expected when running your code.

## Assignment 1: AR Hello World

Attention: **A1:Due Friday Feb 14, 10pm** [Assignments Page](assignments.md)

Using Unity3D and Vuforia (or another AR tool if you prefer), create a simple augmented reality application.

* Download a character from the Asset Store (or, if youâ€™re feeling ambitious, try creating your own!)
* Recognize elements of the physical environment in your application (this can be either image targets or the environment itself)
* Program your character to move between at least three points in the scene.
* Trigger an exciting event when the character reaches its final point!

When submitting, please include a README.txt file with instructions describing how to make your project work, as well as any image targets that you use. It may help to submit a video (e.g. a link to something). I may arrange for you to demo the system in lab (or at a time of mutual convenience).

## Assignment 2: AR Embodied Hello World

_(due TBD)_

Build on your A1 Submission. Implement "embodied" interaction. For example, import a speech recognition asset or use built-in sensors on your device like accelerometers, gyroscopes, proximity sensors, etc. Get creative! You might control your character with your own movements, you might cause events to happen if you move closer or farther from your targets or your character. Implement at least **two** types of embodied interaction that affect the progress of your character.
