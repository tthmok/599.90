# Participation

A large component of your assessment is based on your thoughtful participation in discussions on the topic that we discuss each week. As a part seminar-style class, the focus is on encouraging you to develop your own critical thoughts on the matters being discussed, as well as both your writing and oral skills in presenting these ideas with clarity (arguing them, as necessary).

Each week, a new set of readings will be posted. You are responsible for reading these, and responding to these readings in at least one written paragraph. These are Monday each week at 10pm.

Note: During the in class discussion, I also expect you to contribute to the conversation. (I know this is hard for introverts, which is why you have time to prepare your thoughts in written form.)

In both cases, you may build off of, or respond to others' contributions, or simply strike it out on your own.

## Evaluation

I will evaluate you based on the novelty and clarity of your contributions. These will come in the form of check, check plus, and check minus.

| Feedback | Translation |
|----------|-------------|
| "X"      | You didn't respond. Not cool. |
| Check-   | You wrote something, but I want more. |
| Check    | You've provided a good response that provides a reasonable intellectual contribution. |
| Check+   | You've provided an excellent response to the reading that provides us with an entirely new intellectual direction to consider the reading or the topic area. |

At any time, I am happy to provide you with verbal feedback if you'd like more clarity as to my thinking.

## What is a good response?

I don't need a summary of the reading. A good response is novel (i.e. presents a new idea), and is written clearly (i.e. others can understand what you mean). It does not have to be long. 1 to 2 paragraphs is fine, 1 page is too long. 

It is hard to provide a prescription for doing this, since it varies based on the reading itself. What I am asking you to do is to really *think* about what is in the writing, and then *reflect* on it. For example:

* What does the reading mean to you?
* What does it make you think of?
* Do you agree with what the authors are saying? Do you disagree? Why?
* Are instances where what the authors are saying don't make sense, or doesn't work?
* Would this reading make sense in a different cultural context?
* What aspects of this reading are important in 10 years?
* What aspects of this reading are interesting given recent developments? (And wouldn't have been interesting five years ago?)
* What should researchers or developers be thinking about in the next five years?

**Please go beyond these questions in your thought process!** These are only examples.
