# Project

In a team (3+ members), you will design a mixed reality user experience. You will meet as a group on a regular basis, working to understand the problem space, design the user experience, develop the user experience, as well as evaluate the user experience to the best of your ability. Your goal here is not to have a "finished product", instead, we are looking for a prototype that illustrates and communicates the user experience of the application.

## Concept

Creating interesting augmented reality applications means considering both the virtual and physical world. Simple augmented reality demos, espcially those for mobile phones, tend to simply show some 3D virtual object that looks like it is part of the real world but has no other interactions with it. For this class we are interested in trying to take non-interactive augmented reality a step further. I am interested in applications that impact or are impacted by the physical world.

Your project will involve the design and creation of an augmented reality application. You will explore your potential designs and how they "blend" the virtual and phsycal world. I am looking for something beyond a 3D visualization that simply exists in a camera's viewfinder.

## Evaluation

You will be assessed on the quality and clarity of the communication for each sub-component here. You will also be assessed on your engagement with your team: document your preparations for each meeting, along with the outcomes from that meeting. Finally, you will be evaluated on the final outcome of your project, though you will describe how you expect your project to be evaluated (more on this below).

| Component                                       |  Weighting   |
|-------------------------------------------------|------|
| Project Part 0: Mini-Proposal                   |   0  |
| Project Part 1: Proposal                        |  20  |
| Project Part 2: Progress Report and Critique    |  40  |
| Project Part 3: Final Report                    |  40  |

Project Parts 1 to 3 will also have corresponding in-class presentations where you will have a chance to get feedback from your peers.

## Part 0: Mini-Proposal

Develop a one paragraph mini-proposal that describes the basic idea for the project and the team members (and their anticipated "roles"), when you plan to have meetings, and whatever else you think Terrance should know.

To submit, use your project channel for your group in Slack (e.g. #project-xyz), and add Terrance. Submit the paragraph as a message to the channel with me @'ed.

## Part 1: Proposal

Attention: **P1:Proposal Due Friday Feb 7, 10pm**

The proposal should provide a clear high-level picture of what you are planning on designing and developing. You will also explore your design and development goal by providing a set of early sketches, notes from team meetings, and a timeline for your project.

Criteria for evaluation on this component:

* How clear is the goal of the project?
* How clear is the outcome of the project from a user experience perspective? (illustrated via sketches and writing)
* How clear are the results of your team meetings? For example, include who was at each meeting, what tasks were assigned to each person, what aspects of the project were discussed or reviewed.
* How realistic is the timeline?

***Sketches***
Each person in your team should create at least 5 sketches of potential interactions in your application. Thus there should be at least 15 sketches in your report. You will be graded on clarity of your sketches as individuals. You don't have to be an artist just try to make things clear and understandable. Use labelling and additional notes liberally on sketches to help explain.

***Presentation***
You will develop and give a five-minute presentation (PPT) based on your proposal.

Attention: **P1:Presentation in class Thursday Feb 6**

***Deliverable***
This component should be submitted as a PDF report via your Slack project channel. Sketches should be included in the document (or via self-contained zip file if using some external tool). Summaries of team meetings should also be included as an appendix.

## Part 2: Progress Report and Critique

This report should provide a clear understanding of the expected user experience, the challenges your team has faced, and how you will resolve or address these challenges. You should provide a video prototype of your expected user experience, where components that have been developed should be shown in "working" order, and the other components mocked up. Your progress report should illustrate the depth of your design exploration. How you explore your design and provide evidence of that exploration is up to you and will be unique for each project. Some possible ideas include but are not limited to creating additional sketches, simple prototypes, feedback from peers, and performing a heuristic evaluation. You should revisit your timeline, and the rubric for how you expect your project to be evaluated.

New to this component is a tentative plan for further evaluating the mixed reality user experience.

Criteria for evaluation on this component:

* How clear is the goal of the project?
* How clear is the outcome of the project from a user experience perspective? (illustrated via the sketches/prototypes)
* How realistic is the timeline?
* How appropriate is the evaluation rubric?

***Presentation***
You will develop and give a ten-minute presentation (PPT) based on your progress, and engage in a constructive critique session with your  classmates.

## Part 3: Final Report

**The Report - 50%.** This final report should be a standalone report that provides a clear description of the user experience that you have designed, as well as the considerations that went into designing this user experience (e.g. if you did observations, what did these observations tell you; what requirements did you develop; and/or based on early design iterations, how did this affect the final decisions that you made in the design). If you chose to do an evaluation of your system, describe the method that you chose to execute, what you asked participants to do, and what you learned from that evaluation. You will also want to include a section that describes "Future Work." This should be partially aspirational (i.e. "If I Had a Million Dollars"), and it should also be grounded closer to the reality of your work (i.e. "Well, we did this, but what we learned was that we obviously should have tweaked it to do this").

Include your latest assessment rubric in the report -- this is either exactly the one that was included in your Part 2, or one that you have updated since then.

As an appendix, you should include documentation of your overall process. For instance, include sketches of early ideas and/or images/pictures of earlier prototypes.

**A Video - 15%.** Include a "final video" that does its best to illustrate the designed user experience. This can be as long or as short as you like, though I would probably expect a 3-5 minute video. The style us up to you, but you might consider doing this in "first person shooter" style (where we watch it from the person's perspective who is interacting with the system), or as a "narrative" style (where we watch someone else's interactions), or some mix (or maybe something else I haven't thought of). Make sure to title the video and have all of the authors in the title slate of the video.

I don't need the production value of this video to be off the charts; however, remember that this is likely the _only_ documentation of your project that will last beyond a year. You will want a good video that you can include in a portfolio (e.g. for prospective employers or for yourselves), so do put some care into it.

**The Letter - 15%.** This is a self-reflection piece that is really important. I want your team to draft a letter to the "four months ago" version of itself. In it, I want you to: (1) describe what you did, and (2) provide advice to yourselves about how to do it better. In the "describe what you did" part, I want you to describe the work that each member completed, the nature of your interactions as a team, and all of the technical hurdles/challenges that you overcame. In the "provide advice to yourselves" part, I want you to provide advice about how you could have improved your team function/dynamics, planning, execution, and so on.

Be honest with yourselves. It is a moment to feel proud of yourselves, and it is a learning opportunity.

Really take the time to think about this, please. I think if you felt the project went perfectly, then you're either deluding yourselves, or not reflecting on the experience hard enough. ;-)

All members of the team MUST have read the entire document, and each member must sign off on it with a signature (this can be a digital signature if necessary).

**Presentation - 20%.** Develop a 10 minute presentation (PPT) for the final class. You may show your video and/or discuss your prototype/experience. Ensure that you describe "what you would do next" if you had another 6 months. Also, expect 5 minutes of questions after your presentation.

**Assessment.** I will use all four of these components in your final assessment. Because I asked for a rubric for each project (and each rubric is slightly different), I will weight components of your report differently depending on the project. I have included percentage weighting above as a rough guide.
