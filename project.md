# Project

@TODO remove client focus and update

In a team (3+ members), you will design a mixed reality user experience. You will meet as a group on a regular basis, working to understand the problem space, design the user experience, develop the user experience, as well as evaluate the user experience to the best of your ability. Your goal here is not to have a "finished product", instead, we are looking for a prototype that illustrates and communicates the user experience of the application.

You will be assessed on the quality and clarity of the communication for each sub-component here. You will also be assessed on your engagement with your team: document your preparations for each meeting, along with the outcomes from that meeting. Finally, you will be evaluated on the final outcome of your project, though you will describe how you expect your project to be evaluated (more on this below).

## Part 0: Mini-Proposal

Develop a one paragraph mini-proposal that describes the basic idea for the project, the client, the team members (and their anticipated "roles"), and whatever else you think Terrance should know.

To submit, create a submission channel for your group in Slack (e.g. #teamCoolSubmission), and add Terrance. Submit the paragraph as a message to the message with me @'ed.

## Part 1: Proposal

The proposal should provide a clear picture of who the client is, what you are planning on designing and developing, a set of early sketches that you have already shared (along with feedback from your client), a tentative rubric for how you expect your project to be evaluated, and a timeline for your project.

You will develop and give a five-minute presentation (PPT) based on your proposal.

Criteria for evaluation on this component:

* How clear is the goal of the project?
* How clear is the outcome of the project from a user experience perspective? (illustrated via the sketches/prototypes)
* How has the team engaged with the client, to what extent have they sought to provide feedback, and is it clear how they will make use of that feedback?
* How realistic is the timeline?
* How appropriate is the evaluation rubric?

This component should be submitted as a PDF report via your Slack submission channel. Sketches should be included in the document (or via self-contained zip file if using some external tool). Summaries of interactions with your clients should be included as an appendix.

## Part 2: Progress Report and Critique

This report should provide a clear understanding of the expected user experience, the challenges your team has faced, and how you will resolve or address these challenges. You should provide a video prototype of your expected user experience, where components that have been developed should be shown in "working" order, and the other components mocked up. Much like your proposal, your progress report should illustrate the depth of your interaction with your client (feedback you have received, along with how you will address the feedback). It should also revisit your timeline, and also the rubric for how you expect your project to be evaluated. New to this component is a tentative plan for evaluating the mixed reality user experience.

You will develop and give a ten-minute presentation (PPT) based on your progress, and engage in a constructive critique session with your fellow classmates.

Criteria for evaluation on this component:

* How clear is the goal of the project?
* How clear is the outcome of the project from a user experience perspective? (illustrated via the sketches/prototypes)
* How has the team engaged with the client, to what extent have they sought to provide feedback, and is it clear how they will make use of that feedback?
* How realistic is the timeline?
* How appropriate is the evaluation rubric?

## Part 3: Final Report

**The Report - 50%.** This final report should be a standalone report that provides a clear description of the user experience that you have designed, as well as the considerations that went into designing this user experience (e.g. if you did observations, what did these observations tell you; and/or based on your interactions with your client, what requirements did you develop; and/or based on early design iterations, how did this affect the final decisions that you made in the design). If you chose to do an evaluation of your system, describe the method that you chose to execute, what you asked participants to do, and what you learned from that evaluation. You will also want to include a section that describes "Future Work." This should be partially aspirational (i.e. "If I Had a Million Dollars"), and it should also be grounded closer to the reality of your work (i.e. "Well, we did this, but what we learned was that we obviously should have tweaked it to do this").

Include your latest assessment rubric in the report -- this is either exactly the one that was included in your Part 2, or one that you have updated since then.

As an appendix, you may choose to include documentation of your overall process. For instance, you might include sketches of early ideas and/or images/pictures of earlier prototypes.

**A Video - 15%.** Include a "final video" that does its best to illustrate the designed user experience. This can be as long or as short as you like, though I would probably expect a 3-5 minute video. The style us up to you, but you might consider doing this in "first person shooter" style (where we watch it from the person's perspective who is interacting with the system), or as a "narrative" style (where we watch someone else's interactions), or some mix (or maybe something else I haven't thought of). Make sure to title the video and have all of the authors in the title slate of the video.

I don't need the production value of this video to be off the charts; however, remember that this is likely the _only_ documentation of your project that will last beyond a year. You will want a good video that you can include in a portfolio (e.g. for prospective employers or for yourselves), so do put some care into it.

**The Letter - 15%.** This is a self-reflection piece that is really important. I want your team to draft a letter to the "four months ago" version of itself. In it, I want you to: (1) describe what you did, and (2) provide advice to yourselves about how to do it better. In the "describe what you did" part, I want you to describe the work that each member completed, the nature of your interactions as a team, and all of the technical hurdles/challenges that you overcame. In the "provide advice to yourselves" part, I want you to provide advice about how you could have improved your team function/dynamics, planning, execution, interactions with client (or maybe choice of client?), and so on.

Be honest with yourselves. It is a moment to feel proud of yourselves, and it is a learning opportunity.

Really take the time to think about this, please. I think if you felt the project went perfectly, then you're either deluding yourselves, or not reflecting on the experience hard enough. ;-)

All members of the team MUST have read the entire document, and each member must sign off on it with a signature (this can be a digital signature if necessary).

**Presentation - 20%.** Develop a 10 minute presentation (PPT) for the final class. You may show your video and/or discuss your prototype/experience. Ensure that you describe "what you would do next" if you had another 6 months. Also, expect 5 minutes of questions after your presentation.

**Assessment.** I will use all four of these components in your final assessment. Because I asked for a rubric for each project (and each rubric is slightly different), I will weight components of your report differently depending on the project (most of the rubrics made reference only to the report itself). I have included percentage weighting above as a rough guide.
